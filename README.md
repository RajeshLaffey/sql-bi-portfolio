## 👋 About Me  

I’m Rajesh “Jesse” Laffey — an analyst with 7+ years of experience in **compliance, risk management, financial services (payments), and process improvement**. My work has consistently focused on bridging governance requirements with practical, sustainable solutions that improve efficiency and strengthen oversight.  

Across my career, I’ve:  
- Translated complex regulatory guidance into policies, workflows, and monitoring tools.  
- Built governance frameworks that improve accuracy, accountability, and transparency.  
- Led cross-functional projects that modernized processes, improved documentation practices, and introduced automation.  
- Supported teams through change management and training, ensuring adoption of new tools and practices.  
- Delivered process and compliance solutions in high-volume financial services environments, including payments, deposits, and account operations.  

What drives me is making compliance and governance practical and accessible — creating systems where accuracy is embedded, accountability is clear, and teams feel empowered to focus on meaningful work rather than manual processes.

This portfolio is a growing collection of projects that reflect that approach: turning complex requirements into clear, usable, and well-documented solutions.
